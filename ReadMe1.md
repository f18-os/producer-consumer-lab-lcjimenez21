# Producer Consumer Lab

For this lab I had to implement the Producer-Consumer algorithm in order
to extract frames from a video that would later be converted to gray frames
to finally display then as a video. In order to implement this I used 2 queues
because I had my extract as a producer and my convert as a consumer that I also
used as a producer to finally display as a consumer.

## To run the code:
`$ ./P-C.py`
